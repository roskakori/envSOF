PURPOSE

   This directory contains the full source code for the syntax parser
   and the feature scanner.

   If you want to recompile them or play around, you need DICE. You
   can download it from Aminet.

SCANNER

   The scanner is pretty simple and consists of just one source file.
   This should be straight forward.

   However, one important thing to know is the "-ms1" option for DCC
   in the DMakefile. This makes the string constants like "infix" and
   "frozen" end up in the code hunk, so that they are also loaded.
   Otherwise, the whole string comparison stuff with try_skip_word()
   won't work.

   Use "dmake" to compile.

SYNTAX PARSER

   The syntax parser is a lot more complicated. Most of the source
   files are from Dietmar Eilert's generic_parser example and have not
   been touched much.

   Changed or added files are:

      funcs.c - Implements the actual parser.

      tag.a - Declares symbols with the name of parser (_LibName and
      LibId). If these do not match the name in funcs.c, the parser
      won't show up in the configuration window.

      lib.c - Library wanking. My only change was to open
      rexxsyslib.library to be able to communicate with ISpell.

      debug.(c|h) - some auxiliary routines because I couldn't figure
      out how to use kprintf() with Dice.

   Use "dmake" to compile.

TEST PROGRAMS

   There are a few files named #?test#?. As you might have guessed
   already, they are for testing purpose.

Thomas.
